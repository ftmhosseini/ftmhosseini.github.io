I added a background image. In the time section, I used a grid layout with one column displaying the company logo. I removed the text link for the company name and replaced it with a clickable company logo. When the screen size becomes small, the logo is hidden. Initially, the company’s numbered information is displayed as an alert, and this block can be closed by clicking the close icon.
